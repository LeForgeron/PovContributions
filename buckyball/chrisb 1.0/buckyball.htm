This model illustrates a simple way of building a buckyball. A sphere and a couple of linking bars are rotated around a point to form a pentagon. Two pentagons are joined together and the assembly is duplicated six times with these constructs being translated and rotated into position. 
<P>
Notice that it is easy to replace the sphere definition of the Atom by any other shape. Replace it with a face and you get 60 faces in space.

A buckyball is a football shaped carbon 60 mollecule. The name is really Buckminster-Fullerene.
