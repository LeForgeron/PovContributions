DESCRIPTION

This include file contains a collection of pigments that, when 
used along with the appropriate shapes, may be used to make a 
color solid. The HSL, HSV and RGB color models are supported, 
as well as the following shapes.

- cube (HSL, HSV, RGB), bottom corner centered on the origin
- cylinder (HSL, HSV, RGB), base centered on the origin
- cone (HSV), bottom vertex centered on the origin
- double-cone (HSL), centered on the origin
- parametric sphere (HSL, HSV, RGB), centered on the origin
- Munsell sphere (HSL, HSV, RGB), centered on the origin

The names of the pigments are as follows.

- CSolid_HSLCube_Pigment
- CSolid_HSLCylinder_Pigment
- CSolid_HSLDblCone_Pigment
- CSolid_HSLSphere_Pigment
- CSolid_HSLMunsell_Pigment
- CSolid_HSVCube_Pigment
- CSolid_HSVCone_Pigment
- CSolid_HSVCylinder_Pigment
- CSolid_HSVSphere_Pigment
- CSolid_HSVMunsell_Pigment
- CSolid_RGBCube_Pigment
- CSolid_RGBCylinder_Pigment
- CSolid_RGBSphere_Pigment
- CSolid_RGBMunsell_Pigment

The last one doesn't work yet for reasons I haven't been able 
to figure out.
