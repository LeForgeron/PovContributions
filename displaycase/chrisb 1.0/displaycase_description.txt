The 'DisplayCase' macros add Spherical, Oblong, Cylindrical and Box-shaped display cases to your scene. You can easily adjust the default settings including the dimensions of the display case and the material settings for the component parts, such as pigment, finish, interior etc. Any of the cases can be mounted on a selection of mount types, including a "Tree" structure that supports a configurable number of display cases.
