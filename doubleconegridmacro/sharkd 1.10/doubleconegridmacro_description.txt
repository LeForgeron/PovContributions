This macro creates an object in the shape of a grid of angle, height and radius lines found on a double-cone. The thickness of the "lines" of the grid remains constant. The object can be used as an object within a CSG operation (e.g., intersection or difference), or as an object pattern (e.g., a pigment). An example scene is provided to show three different ways of using the object.
