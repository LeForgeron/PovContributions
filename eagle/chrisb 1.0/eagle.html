  <h1>Overview</h1>
This model was created by George Leonberger in Moray. He has given his permission for it to be converted to a POV-Ray include file and released under the terms of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/LGPL/2.1/">CC-LGPL</a> to enable you to use, modify and redistribute it for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.  You can help improve the model by submitting enhanced versions back into the collection by registering yourself on the web site.  This download consists of:
<ul>
<li>an include file containing the Eagle Transporter model
<li>an include file containing the textures used in the model
<li>various gif and tga images used to apply textures and logos to specific elements of the model
<li>a sample scene file to illustrate the use of the include file
<li>the original Moray model file
<li>a copy of this documentation and the image files used in it
<li>a few other files that you may find handy if you submit a new version to the collection
</ul>
<p>
The TV series, Space 1999 starts with an accidental nuclear explosion on Moonbase Alpha, which blows the moon out of orbit, causing it to leave the solar system and drift through space. The occupants of the moonbase manage to get systems back online and get their Eagle Transport vehicles operating again too late to make it back to Earth. This fleet of transporters was crucial to the survival of the colony as it drifted through space, being used to gather supplies and to defend against alien attack. 
<p>
You can add this Eagle Transporter to your scene file by including the "eagle.inc" file. 
<p>
<div class=codesample>
    light_source { <-15,50,-15>, rgb 1}
<br>camera {location <-23, 10,-10> look_at 3*y}
<br>#include "eagle.inc"        
</div>
<p>
The file returns a single object centred at the origin and standing on the plane Y=0 with the cockpit facing in the -X direction. The Transporter is about 36 POV-Ray units in length and stands about 7 metres high.

<p>
You can wrap it in an object statement and transform it as required to fit into your scene. For example:
<p>
<div class=codesample>
    light_source { <-15,50,-15>, rgb 1}
<br>camera {location <-23, 10,-10> look_at 3*y}
<br>object {
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;#include "eagle.inc"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;scale 0.5
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;rotate <0,30,0> 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;translate <5,0,3>
<br>}       
</div>
<p>
The following images show the Eagle in space, the interior of the cargo bay and the cockpit. Eagle-eyed observers will notice that some of the astronauts anatomy is missing inside the cockpit. These elements seemed to have been present in the Moray file, but generated errors when exported to POV-Ray format. If anyone sufficiently proficient with Moray can fix that, then you can upload a new version or send the updates to me and I'll do it (CB). The Moray model is included in this download.

<h2>Change History</h2>
The initial Eagle Transporter model was created by George Leonberger using Moray. He made it available for download from Geocities until the web server service closed in October 2009, at which point he kindly gave his permission for it to be redistributed on the POV-Ray Object Collection license (CC-LGPL).
<p>
Version 1.0 of the include file was adapted to conform to the naming conventions for the POV-Ray Object Collection by Chris Bartlett in September 2009. All identifiers are now prefixed with 'Eagle_' and all file names start with 'eagle'. The following additional changes were made:
<ul>
<li>The model was centred over the origin to make it easier to orient, move around and resize. 
<li>A POV-Ray scene file was added to illustrate the use of the model.
<li>Various settings were changed to make the model compatible with POV_Ray 3.7.
</ul>
