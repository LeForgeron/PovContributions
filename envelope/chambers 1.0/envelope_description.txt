The 'os_envelope.inc' include file contains the OS_Envelope macro which creates an envelope object based upon the settings of a range of control variables. A number of other macros and files are provided, some of which are used internally by the OS_Envelope macro and some of which deliver additional features.

The OS_Envelope macro was created by Chris Bartlett in January 2008 as part of the 'Office Supplies' theme assembled by Ben Chambers for the POV-Ray Object Collection at http   lib.povray.org  and is licensed under the terms of the CC-LGPL.
