This include file contains an 'Envelope' macro to add an envelope object to a scene. It constructs a custom envelope based on settings that you control, all of which have default values. A number of different pre-defined envelope types are available including ones with and without windows, stickers and stamps. The scene file used to generate the sample images is included to provide examples of using the macro with different settings.
