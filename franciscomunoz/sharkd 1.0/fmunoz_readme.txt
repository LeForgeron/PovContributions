DESCRIPTION

This is a collection of various POV-Ray objects created by 
Francisco Munoz Cotobal sometime in the late '90s. It was 
kindly released into the GPL recently, and I have compiled it 
and uploaded it to the Object Collection.

Here is a link to the forum thread where Francisco stated that 
the objects were released into the GPL:
