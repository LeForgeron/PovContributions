Here's an Earth-like planet texture I was working on but never 
ended up completing. It currently looks good enough to release 
in its unfinished state. Maybe I'll continue working on it at 
some time in the future. Some of the missing planned features 
include:

1) snow cover based on average daily energy from the sun
   (calculated using orbital mechanics);
2) rivers;
3) aridness based also on proximity to water;
4) erosion;
5) cloud cover and upper atmosphere;
6) water reflectivity.

The demo file contains a variable called "HPlanet_Show_Mode" 
that allows you to switch between the different views I was 
using when constructing the scene.
