<b><a name="1.0">1.0 Introduction</a></b><br>
<br>
Thank you for downloading this include file! It started out rather small, but soon became the full-featured
include file you see before you.<br>
<br>
To contact me about this file, write me at <b>stbenge@hotmail.com</b><br>
<br>
<b><a name="1.1">1.1 Description</a></b><br>
<br>
This include file lets you make brick arches, single arch bricks, pillars
or single pillar bricks by way of object macros. The objects it creates are
heightfield-based, meaning you can declare special patterns to change the shape of each brick.
Certain speed considerations are taken into account.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="1.2">1.2 How it works</a></b><br>
<br>
Each brick making up the arch is based on a heightfield which is clipped or
intersected independently. The pattern for each brick is scaled to the exact
size needed by the heightfield. This improves efficiency during parsing, resulting
in lower render times.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="1.3">1.3 What it can do</a></b><br>
<br>
These macros let you easily create brick arches and brick pillars with a few simple commands.
By default the bricks are one-sided, for use on walls. By changing some values,
however, you can make the bricks two-sided for use on free-standing pillars.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="1.4">1.4 Contents</a></b><br>
<br>
The include file contains:</a></b><br>
<br> 
*A brick arch macro<br>
*A single arch brick macro<br>
*A brick pillar macro<br>
*A single pillar brick macro<br>
*Several variables to manipulate the brick shape, texture and detail<br>
*A macro to reset the variables<br>
<br>
_____________________________<br>

<b><a name="2.0">2.0 Getting Started</a></b><br>
<br>
Drop the include file into POV-Ray's include directory or the directory where you
intend to use it. After that just include the file like so:<br>
<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#include "stbHFarch.inc"<br>
</b>
<br>

<b><a name="2.1">2.1 Your first arch</a></b><br>
<br>
Since there are default values for everything, you can simply invoke the arch macro:<br>
<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
object{ stbHFarch_brick_arch(12, 4, 180, 9, 1)  pigment{rgb 0.5}}<br>
</b>
<br>
The 'stbHFarch_brick_arch' macro takes five arguments. The first represents the
radius of the arch. The second is the thickness of the arch brick. It is important to
consider that this value changes the inner radius of the arch, not the outer radius. That
means by using the values above, the inner radius of the arch would be 8. The third number
is the arch's range. A value of 180 gives this arch a classic look, while 360 would produce
a complete circle, perfect for a tunnel entrance. You may use any value less than or equal
to 360. The fourth number is the number of bricks for a given range. In this example there
are 9 bricks making up the arch. The fifth parameter defines the arch brick's depth, or bas-relief.<br>
<br>

<b><a name="2.2">2.2 Changing the brick's shape</a></b><br>
<br>
There are actually two ways to do this, and both ways will result in a brick custom-fitted to the arch.<br>
<br>
The first way is to change the brick's shape pattern directly, like so:<br>
<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#declare stbHFarch_brick_pattern =<br>
&nbsp;pigment_map{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[0.0  rgb 0.0  ]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[0.05 rgb 0.75 ]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[0.1  rgb 0.95 ]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[0.25 rgb 1.0  ]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[0.4  rgb 0.95 ]<br>
&nbsp;}<br>
</b>
<br>
The first entry represents the edge of the brick, and the last entry represents the the edge
going towards the middle of the brick. So 'rgb 0.0' ensures the edge slopes inward, like
you would expect a brick to be. You can use any pigment you wish (this includes procedural patterns),
and the pigment will be rotated with each brick.<br>
<br>
Note that when using this method, the contour of the brick will be a fixed distance from the edge.
In other words, the edges of the brick will be the same thickness no matter what values you pass
to the arch or single brick macro.<br>
<br>
The second way to change the brick's shape pattern is to declare a pattern override, like so:<br>
<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#declare stbHFarch_pattern_override =<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;pigment{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boxed scallop_wave frequency 4<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</b>
<br>
This method is fundamentally different from the first. Instead of relying on a built-in edge
function, you are explicitly telling the macro to force a pattern to the brick shape. In this
case, I used the pattern 'boxed' to define the brick's shape. The shape will be warped to fit
the brick exactly.<br>
<br>

<b><a name="2.3">2.3 Texturing the arch</a></b><br>
<br>
You may add a texture inside the object{} block where the macro invocation resides, but a more
powerful way is to declare the texture beforehand. This lets you apply incremental texture
positioning so that each brick appears to have it's own separate texture. Try this:<br>
<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#declare stbHFarch_brick_texture_offset = <0,0,10>;<br>
<br>
#declare stbHFarch_brick_texture =<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;texture{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pigment{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;granite scale 7<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</b>
<br>
'stbHFarch_brick_texture_offset' translates the texture for each new brick in the arch.
The texture is first translated by <0,0,10>*0, next by <0,0,10>*1, next by <0,0,10>*2 and so on.<br>
<br>
The texture's size is not relative to the arch, but literal. However, the texture does rotate
with each brick, so keep that in mind.<br>
<br>

<b><a name="2.4">2.4 Changing the brick's heightfield resolution</a></b><br>
<br>
If you are experiencing long parse times or bad results, you may want to change how detailed
the heightfield is for the brick. You can do this by declaring new values this way:<br>
<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#declare stbHFarch_brick_res = <200,200>;<br>
</b>
<br>
The default values are <100,100>.<br>
<br>

<b><a name="2.5">2.5 Making double-sided bricks</a></b><br>
<br>
By default the bricks are one-sided, with the outside facing -z. For your scene you may need
the bricks to be two-sided. This would be the case if you were modeling an arbor. The simplest
way to do this is do change the default value:<br>
<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#declare stbHFarch_brick_mirror = yes;<br>
</b>
<br>
By turning mirroring on, you are telling the macro to make another copy facing in the +z direction.<br>
<br>
In some cases, there may be an unwated ridge where the two brick surfaces meet. To avoid this,
you can have each brick intersected with another, custom-fitted, CSG brick shape. Try doing this:<br>
<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#declare stbHFarch_brick_intersection = 0.05;<br>
</b>
<br>
By default, this value is 0, meaning no intersection takes place. Positive values scale the
CSG brick shape down which results in a slightly smaller brick, but edges which are smooth.
As you might have already guessed, doing this will increase the render time.<br>
<br>
You may use this feature for one-sided bricks as well, but they will render more slowly than
two-sided bricks. I'm not exactly sure why, but it helps to know.<br>

<br>

<b><a name="3.2.1.2">3.2.1.2 stbHFarch_brick_pattern_offset</a></b><br>
<br>    
If not zero, it translates the pattern along the z-axis for each new brick in the arch or pillar.
Use in conjuction with your own brick pattern. This feature can result in long parsing times, so use
it only if you really need to.<br>
<br>
example code:<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#declare stbHFarch_brick_pattern_offset = 1.0;<br>
</b>
<br>
default = 0<br>
<br>

<b><a name="3.2.1.3">3.2.1.3 stbHFarch_brick_pattern_reset</a></b><br>
<br>
This resets the pattern used by the arch or pillar macro. It effectively 'snaps' the pattern to
3d space, allowing you to create effects like world-oriented lattice between brick edges. It can
be used with both 'stbHFarch_brick_pattern' and 'stbHFarch_pattern_override'.
This feature can result in long parsing times, so use it only if you really need to.<br>
<br>
example code:<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#declare stbHFarch_brick_pattern_reset = yes;<br>
</b>
<br>
default = no<br>
<br>

<b><a name="3.2.1.4">3.2.1.4 stbHFarch_pattern_override</a></b><br>
<br>
If used, it overrides 'stbHFarch_brick_pattern', letting you make your own pattern for the brick from scratch.
Your pattern must lie within <-1,-1,0>,<1,1,0> in 3d space. The pattern will be warped to fit the
brick shape exactly.<br>
<br>
example code:<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#declare stbHFarch_pattern_override=<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;pigment{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boxed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</b>
<br>
By default this is not declared.<br>
<br>

<b><a name="3.2.1.5">3.2.1.5 stbHFarch_brick_mirror</a></b><br>
<br>
Makes an extra copy of the brick in the +z direction. Use this to make 'complete' bricks.<br>
<br>
example code:<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#declare stbHFarch_brick_mirror = yes;<br>
</b>
<br>
default = no<br>
<br>

<b><a name="3.2.1.6">3.2.1.6 stbHFarch_brick_clipping_depth</a></b><br>
<br>
By default the brick is intersected with a plane facing in the +z direction.
'stbHFarch_brick_clipping_depth' lets you specify how much clipping is performed on the brick.
If effectively moves the clipping plane in the -z direction, and then moves the entire brick
in the +z direction to ensure that it lies at z=0. This is most useful if you have mirroring
turned on. It will <b>only</b> work with clipping mode 1 (see stbHFarch_clipping_mode below).<br>
<br>
example code:<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#declare stbHFarch_brick_clipping_depth = 0.125;<br>
</b>
<br>
By default it is set to a small value relative to the brick's depth.<br>
<br>

<b><a name="3.2.1.7">3.2.1.7 stbHFarch_clipping_mode</a></b><br>
<br>
There are four clipping modes available to you:<br>
0 = no clipping<br>
1 = clipped by +z facing plane<br>
2 = clipped by brick shape<br>
3 = same as 2, but useful if the brick gets black edges<br>
<br>
If you want to see the heightfield before it's clipped, use no clipping. You may also
want to disable clipping if your bricks lie on a -z facing plane (ie. plane{-z,.01}).<br>
<br>
example code:<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#declare stbHFarch_clipping_mode = 2;<br>
</b>
<br>
default = 1<br>
<br>

<b><a name="3.2.1.8">3.2.1.8 stbHFarch_brick_intersection</a></b><br>
<br>
Intersects the brick with another brick shape.<br>
<br>
Positive values scale the intersecting brick shape downwards, thus providing a means to
separate the bricks from each other and to remove unwanted ridge lines (often produced
when mirroring is turned on). This feature will increase the render time; I suggest not using it.
In most cases increasing 'stbHFarch_brick_clipping_depth' will do the job.
<br>
<br>
example code:<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#declare stbHFarch_brick_intersection = 0.125;<br>
</b>
default = 0 (off)<br>
<br>

<b><a name="3.2.2">3.2.2 Brick texture manipulation</a></b><br>
<br>
Following are two variables to control the texture for the 'stbHFarch_brick_arch' and
'stbHFarch_pillar' macros.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="3.2.2.1">3.2.2.1 stbHFarch_brick_texture</a></b><br>
<br> 
With this you can designate a texture to be used with the 'tbHFarch_brick_arch' and
'stbHFarch_pillar' macros. It will be rotated and/or translated, depending on the macro used.<br>
<br>
example code:<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#declare stbHFarch_brick_texture=<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;texture{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pigment{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spherical scale 4<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</b>
<br>
By default there is no texture.<br>
<br>
 
<b><a name="3.2.2.2">3.2.2.2 stbHFarch_brick_texture_offset</a></b><br>
<br>
This will incrementally offset 'stbHFarch_brick_texture' by a given vector. Each new brick in
the arch or pillar will be offset by this amount. Using this allows you to give the impression
that all the bricks have different textures. Note that if you use this feature with
'stbHFarch_pillar', the bricks to the left will be offset by an additional 1.5 units in the +z
direction. This is to remove 'sameness' from the offset brick texture.<br>
<br>
example code:<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#declare stbHFarch_brick_texture_offset = <0,0,1.0>;<br>

<b><a name="3.2.3">3.2.3 Heightfield manipuation</a></b><br>

<br>

<b><a name="3.2.3.1">3.2.3.1 stbHFarch_brick_res</a></b><br>

Changes the resolution of the heightfield which makes the bricks. Use this if you are getting
heightfield 'jaggies'.<br>

<br>

<b><a name="3.2.3.2">3.2.3.2 stbHFarch_brick_smooth</a></b><br>
<br>
Do want the triangles making the heightfield to <b>not</b> be smooth? Use this.<br>
<br>
example code:<br>
<b style="color : rgb(255,0,0);">
#declare stbHFarch_brick_smooth = no;<br>
</b>
<br>
default = yes<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>

<b><a name="4.0">4.0 Speed Considerations</a></b><br>
<br>
These macros are meant to parse and render quickly. The pattern the heightfield uses to make
each brick is carefully scaled and translated to fit the heightfield exactly at render time.
This is to ensure the least amount of heightfield space is wasted. For both the arch and pillar
macros the heightfield brick is copied and rotated/translated several times. This is to save
both RAM and parsing time.<br>
<br>
There are times, however, when you may experience long parse times. This can be due to a
number of things. The items in the following list can significantly increase parsing time:<br>
<br>
*stbHFarch_brick_pattern_offset<br>
*stbHFarch_brick_pattern_reset<br>
*stbHFarch_brick_res<br>
<br>
The first two items, if used, will make separate instances of the brick for either the
'stbHFarch_brick_arch' or 'stbHFarch_pillar' macros. That means each brick making up the object
will be parsed independently from the rest. So, if you have an arch with five elements which
previously took 1 second to parse, it would now take 5-10 seconds to parse! Combined with the
last item, you may see very high parse times (not to mention RAM usage).<br>
<br>
You may also consider not using the brick intersection feature. It will only make the render time
longer. There is almost always a way around having to use it.<br>
<br>
Additionally, if you intend to use a brick, arch, or pillar more than once in your scene, you
may want to #declare it first, and then use it later. That way POV is not having to parse each macro
individually.
