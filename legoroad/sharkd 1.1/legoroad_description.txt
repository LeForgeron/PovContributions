This include file contains macros that generate Lego LDraw-
style roads that can be formed into various shapes. There are
macros for
- creating straight roads
- creating elliptical roads
- creating spiral roads
- creating spline-shaped roads

Also supported is super-elevation (banking) of the roads. This
can be enabled and disabled when calling the macro.
