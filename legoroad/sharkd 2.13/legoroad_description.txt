This include file contains macros that generate LDraw (Lego)
style roads that can be formed into various shapes. There are
macros for
- creating straight roads
- creating elliptical roads
- creating spiral roads
- creating spline-shaped roads
- creating straight roads that intersect at any angle

Also supported is super-elevation (banking) of the roads. This
can be enabled and disabled when calling the macro.

There is actually a lot you can do to modify or customize the macro, so doesn't have to just be used for Lego.
