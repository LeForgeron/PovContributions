Lathes are often useful to easily create objects like wineglasses, pots, etc. However, often they can be rather slow to render. This include file creates a triangle mesh from a spline by rotating it around the y axis, similarly to how the lathe object works. Several options and parameters to define the amount of triangles and debugging features are supported, as demonstrated in the example pov file and the image (rendered from it).
