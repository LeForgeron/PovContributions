The meshrelief include file comprises a set of macros that create meshes of simple shapes, and displace the surfaces according to a predefined pigment. These macros are intended for creating realistic, but relatively low-detail, building blocks that can be copied many times to build structures, and render many times faster than the equivalent isosurfaces.
