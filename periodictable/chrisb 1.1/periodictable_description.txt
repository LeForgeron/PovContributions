The Periodic Table of Elements, made up of coloured blocks with text engraved into their surface. This can be rendered using an orthographic camera to give a conventional flat view or in 3D with a perspective camera. You can easily change the shapes, fonts and colors to suit your particular needs.
This version adds borders showing whether elements are natural (primordial), the results of decay of other elements, or sythesised. It also adds column titles and a header.
