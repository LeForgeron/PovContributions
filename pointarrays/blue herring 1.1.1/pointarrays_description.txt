This is a set of macros to allow the manipulation of arrays of point vectors, and the ability to create objects from them.  Arrays of vectors can be used to create prisms, lathes, and sphere_sweeps.  Additionally, there are macros to create cut lathe arcs, and a sphere sweep that follows a 3D bezier curve.  All of the object macros allow transforms to be applied to the points when the object is created.  This allows the same set of points to be used for multiple shapes.  For example lathes can be created with different diameters without scaling or creating a new spline for each shape.
