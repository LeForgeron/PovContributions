This object represents a traditional Halloween lantern made from a pumpkin. It is constructed using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) to assemble primitive POV-Ray objects. The main shape consists of a set of a squashed spheres rotated around an axis to give a sort of segmented look. A lighter orange coloured sphere is then cut out from the centre and a variety of light orange coloured holes are poked through to make eyes, nose and mouth. 
<P>
The lighting uses a light source outside the pumpkin and two lights inside the pumpkin. One is a bright light close to the bottom of the inside surface, this is about where a candle would be. The other is a spotlight shining down on the first just to make the candle area glow a bit more.
