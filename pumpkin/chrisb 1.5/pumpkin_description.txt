This include file contains a macro to generate a pumpkin with the option to have eyes, nose and mouth carved out in the form of a traditional Halloween lantern. It is constructed using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) to assemble primitive POV-Ray objects. The default shape consists of a set of a squashed spheres rotated around an axis to give a sort of segmented look. Optionaly you can elect to use Blob based segments with a configurable amount of randomisation of the surface shape.
