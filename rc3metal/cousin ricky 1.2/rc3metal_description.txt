Macros for creating metallic textures. They produce results that are more realistic-looking than the metallic textures in the standard include files and, being parameter-driven, are more flexible.

Ambient and diffuse levels are automatically adjusted.

In addition, some common metal colors are suggested, and blurred reflection, galvanized metal, and a brushed normal are included.
