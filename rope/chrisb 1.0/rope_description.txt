A set of macros to add ropes to your scene. You can select from a range of different styles and can 'construct' a path for the rope to follow by adding together different rope shapes such as knots, coils and catenaries.
Instructions are included to enable you to add new rope styles (colors, textures, twist etc.) and new custom shapes (eg. more knots).
