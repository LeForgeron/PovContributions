This include file contains a collection of macros used to
generate grids of several different shapes. The grid objects
are untextured, and therefore can be used within CSG
operations. They can also be used within object patterns. The
principle feature is that grid lines always remain a constant
width no matter where they are within the object.

The macros must be called from within an "object" tag.

Several shapes are provided
- Cone
- Cylinder
- Sphere (parametric)
- Sphere (Munsell)
- Double-cone
- Inverted double-cone
