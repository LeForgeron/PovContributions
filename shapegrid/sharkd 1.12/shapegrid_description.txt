This include file contains a collection of macros used to generate grids of
several different shapes. The grid objects are untextured, and therefore can be
used within CSG operations. They can also be used within object patterns. The
principle feature is that grid lines always remain a constant width no matter
where they are within the object.

Several shapes are included
- Cube
- Cone
- Cylinder
- Sphere (parametric)
- Sphere (Munsell)
- Ellipsoid
- Double-cone
- Inverted double-cone
