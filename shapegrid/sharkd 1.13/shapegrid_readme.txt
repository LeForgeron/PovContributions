DESCRIPTION

This include file contains a collection of macros used to generate grids of 
several different shapes. The grid objects are untextured, and therefore can be 
used within CSG operations. They can also be used within object patterns. The 
principle feature is that grid lines always remain a constant width no matter 
where they are within the object.

The macros must be called from within an "object" tag.

Several shapes are provided
- Cube
- Cone
- Cylinder
- Sphere (parametric)
- Sphere (Munsell)
- Ellipsoid
- Double-cone
- Inverted double-cone
