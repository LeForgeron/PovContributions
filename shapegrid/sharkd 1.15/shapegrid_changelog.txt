* Correct error in formula in SGrid_Ellipsoid_Macro.

* I used the wrong implicit function for the hyperbolas in 
  SGrid_Ellipsoid_Macro.

* Use a different method for determining latitude in SGrid_Ellipsoid_Macro 
  copied from "Confocal conic sections" on Wikipedia. This method replaces the 
  truncated cones with hyperbolas.

* Created SGrid_Ellipsoid_Macro for ellipsoids. This method models latitude 
  based on equal intervals of geodetic latitude, which form truncated cones.
