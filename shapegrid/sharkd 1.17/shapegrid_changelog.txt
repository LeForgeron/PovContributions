* Renamed the "Munsell Sphere" macro to "Itten Sphere".
* Resurrected the old Ellipsoid routine and renamed it "SGrid_Geodetic_Macro".

* Use parametric formula for generating radius and longitude grid lines in 
  SGrid_Ellipsoid_Macro.

1.15 - 2018-08-03
* Correct error in formula in SGrid_Ellipsoid_Macro.

1.14 - 2018-08-03
* I used the wrong implicit function for the hyperbolas in 
  SGrid_Ellipsoid_Macro.

1.13 - 2018-08-03
* Use a different method for determining latitude in SGrid_Ellipsoid_Macro 
  copied from "Confocal conic sections" on Wikipedia. This method replaces the 
  truncated cones with hyperbolas.

1.12 - 2018-07-24
* Created SGrid_Ellipsoid_Macro for ellipsoids. This method models latitude 
  based on equal intervals of geodetic latitude, which form truncated cones.
