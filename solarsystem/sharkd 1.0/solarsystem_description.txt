This include file will randomly generate a solar system,
complete with sun, moons, planets and asteroid belts. There are
options to render a single planet at a time, or render the
whole system from a bird's-eye view with all orbits drawn and
planet positions marked and numbered. Another option is to
generate an orthographic tiled image suitable for splitting
apart and inserting into a video game as sprites.

Three sample scenes are included to demonstrate the different
scene-rendering options.

Optionally, use Chris Colefax's "GALAXY.INC" and "Lens.inc".
