CHANGE LOG

3.1 alpha - 2018-09-29
* Update starting and ending dates for the orbits and trails.

3.0 alpha - 2018-09-28
* Attempted to model the rotations and obliquity of the planets. Was only 
  partially successful.
* Added markers to gauge planet orientations.
* Renamed the scene files.
* Created another scene file just to monitor planet orientations.

2.2 - 2018-09-19
* Changed textures of planets.
* Tweak lighting.
* Tweak grid lines.
* Can now switch between inner and outer planets.

2.1 - 2018-09-16
* Added textures to planets.
* Tweak lighting.
* Can now switch between gray and black scenes.

2.0 - 2018-09-16
* Discovered that the calculations were incorrect. Could not recall where I got 
  the original formulas from, so I switched to a new set of formulas by the JPL.

1.0 - 2018-09-15
* Initial release.
* Planets do not have texture maps.
* Planets are not tilted with respect to their orbital planes.
* Planets are not oriented such that the correct side of the planet is facing 
  the sun at a given moment.
* Does not include a realistic and accurate star field.
* Does not include Pluto and Ceres.


TO DO LIST

* Should maybe switch the reference frame from the ecliptic to the Sun's 
  equator or the invariable plane.
* Don't forget to model each planet's oblateness!
* Switch to using planet textures from here instead: 
  http://planetpixelemporium.com/planets.html
* Add Ceres and some dwarf planets too. Maybe some moons.
* Planet orientations using rotational elements are still not right. Need to 
  fix them. Especially Earth.
* Could update to more recently measured planet rotational elements.
