CHANGE LOG

3.2 - 2018-10-01
* Changed how start and stop dates are specified.
* Fixed orientation of Saturn's rings texture.

3.1 - 2018-09-29
* Update starting and ending dates for the orbits and trails.

3.0 - 2018-09-28
* Attempted to model the rotation and obliquity of the planets. Was only 
  partially successful. The poles are pointing in the correct direction, at the 
  very least.
* Added markers to gauge planet orientations.
* Renamed the scene files.
* Created another scene file just to monitor planet orientations.

2.2 - 2018-09-19
* Changed textures of planets.
* Tweak lighting.
* Tweak grid lines.
* Can now switch between inner and outer planets.

2.1 - 2018-09-16
* Added textures to planets.
* Tweak lighting.
* Can now switch between gray and black scenes.

2.0 - 2018-09-16
* Discovered that the calculations were incorrect. Could not recall where I got 
  the original formulas from, so I switched to a new set of formulas by the JPL.

1.0 - 2018-09-15
* Initial release.
* Planets do not have texture maps.
* Planets are not tilted with respect to their orbital planes.
* Planets are not oriented such that the correct side of the planet is facing 
  the sun at a given moment.
* Does not include a realistic and accurate star field.
* Does not include Pluto and Ceres.


TO DO LIST

* Should maybe switch the reference frame from the ecliptic to the Sun's 
  equator or the invariable plane.
* Don't forget to model each planet's oblateness!
* Switch to using planet textures from here instead: 
    http://planetpixelemporium.com/planets.html
* Add Ceres and some dwarf planets too. Maybe some moons.
* Planet orientations using rotational elements are still not right. The poles 
  are pointing in the correct directions, but the rotations around the poles 
  are off. Except for Earth and Neptune where I eyeballed the correct rotations.
* Could update to more recently measured planet rotational elements.
* Use a large interior media for the sun's glow instead of the horizontal plane.
