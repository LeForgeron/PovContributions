This include file contains macros for adding staircases to a POV-Ray scene. The macros support both multiple straight flights and spiral staircases. You just need to define the positions of the newel posts and it will do the rest. You can use the various styles of staircase components provided or components of your own design. There are lots of configuration settings you can play with or you can just let them take their default values.
