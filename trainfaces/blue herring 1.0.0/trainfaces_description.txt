The TrainFaces include file was originally designed to create Thomas the Tank Engine style faces, hence its name.  However, it should be flexible enough at this point to be used for other purposes as well.  It can generate face objects, allowing the position, size, shape, and texture, of the eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows, cheeks, and chin to be customized.  Additionally there is the capability of saving the face to a mesh for fast rendering.
