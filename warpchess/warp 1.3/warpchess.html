<h1>WarpChess include file</h1>

<h2>Declared objects</h2>

<p>This include file declares the following untextured objects:

<pre>
WarpChess_Pawn
WarpChess_Rook
WarpChess_Knight
WarpChess_Bishop
WarpChess_Queen
WarpChess_King
</pre>

<p>It also declares textured versions of these objects. These have the
word "<code>White</code>" or "<code>Black</code>" before the piece name, like:

<pre>
WarpChess_WhitePawn
WarpChess_BlackPawn
etc.
</pre>

<p>The materials of the pieces can be modified by #declaring any of these
material identifiers <em>before</em> #including <code>"WarpChess.inc"</code>:

<pre>
WarpChess_BaseMaterial
WarpChess_WhiteMaterial
WarpChess_BlackMaterial
</pre>

<p>The materials can be transparent (and have ior). If the base of the pieces
should not use its own material (but simply share the material of the rest
of the piece), the identifier <code>WarpChess_UseBaseMaterial</code> can
be declared as <code>false</code> before the #include.

<p>If the textured pieces should use a <code>photons</code> block, this can be
achieved by implementing a macro called <code>WarpChess_UsePhotons()</code>
before the #include. This macro should contain the entire photons block (ie.
"<code>photons { ...something... }</code>").

<p>A chessboard is also included as an object:

<pre>
WarpChess_Board
</pre>

<p>The following optional identifiers can be declared <em>before</em>
#including <code>"WarpChess.inc"</code> to set up the texturing and labels:

<pre>
WarpChess_WhiteSquareTexture
WarpChess_BlackSquareTexture
WarpChess_WoodTexture
WarpChess_BoardLettersTexture
WarpChess_BoardFont (default is "timrom.ttf")
</pre>

<p>If <code>WarpChess_BoardFont</code> is declared to be an empty string
the labels will not be created.

<h2>Declared macros</h2>

<p>This include file also defines two macros to create a chessboard with
pieces placed on it:

<pre>
WarpChess_CreateDefaultBoard()
</pre>

<p>Simply creates a chessboard with all the pieces in their initial places.

<pre>
WarpChess_CreateBoard(Moves)
</pre>

<p>Creates a chessboard based on the given moves. The parameter should be
an array of strings, each string denoting a chess move. These moves are
similar to the moves of a regular chess game record. The board situation
is started from the initial position, and pieces are moved according to
the given moves. Captured pieces are moved to the edge of the board.

<p>Example usage:

<pre>
#declare Moves = array[8]
{ "E2E4", "E7E5", "G1F3", "B8C6",
  "D2D3", "F8B4", "B1C3", "G8F6" }

WarpChess_CreateBoard(Moves)
</pre>

<p>The following identifier can be declared <em>before</em> #including
"<code>WarpChess.inc</code>" to affect the placement of captured pieces:

<pre>
WarpChess_DropCapturedPieces (default is false)
</pre>

<p>If <code>WarpChess_DropCapturedPieces</code> is <code>true</code>,
captured pieces will not be created at all, else they will be created at
the ends of the board.

<p>If a piece arrangement which is not the result of a series of moves is
desired, the following macro can be used to make the task easier:

<pre>
WarpChess_TranslatePiece(X_Index, Z_Index)
</pre>

<p>Where X_Index and Z_Index are integers between 0 and 7 (although fractional
values and values outside the range are possible as well). It simply creates a
<code>translate</code> command that moves an origin-centered object on the
corresponding square of the (yet untransformed) board. For example:

<pre>
object { WarpChess_Board }
object { WarpChess_BlackKing WarpChess_TranslatePiece(4, 4) }
</pre>

<p>Note: Since the board is created oriented on the X axis, with the
white side on the positive X side, and the parameters to the macro correspond
directly to world coordinates, the indices (0, 0) correspond to the board
coordinates "A8" and the indices (7, 7) to the board coordinates "H1".
