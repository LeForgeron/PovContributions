This include file defines two macros which can be used to create a Rubik's cube (3x3x3) and a Rubik's Revenge (4x4x4). The measurements are accurate from the real cubes (with 1 pov unit being 1 cm). The rotations of the slices can be specified with a string containing established rotation syntax, and the angle of the last rotation can also be specified (for example to create animations).
