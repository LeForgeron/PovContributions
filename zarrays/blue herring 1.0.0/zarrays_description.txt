A collection of macros for the manipulation of arrays in POV-Ray SDL.  Included are macros to concatenate, merge, print, or fill arrays (with single or random values.)  Additionally, there are macros to create and initialize arrays in one step.  Finally there is a macro that can process all elements of an array with a custom macro supplied by the user.  Most of the macros in this collection function for arrays of one to five dimensions.
