ZChars is intended to extend the usefulness of the objects in chars.inc.  It includes
- Objects for additional common characters not in chars.inc including comma, space, period, colon, semicolon, underline, equals, apostrophe, left and right curly braces, and question mark.
- Macros to convert characters and strings to objects using these internal characters.
- The ability to customize the mapping of any character to any object for any of the conversion macros.
- A replacement macro for the text object, which will automatically fall back to the internal characters if a font file is not found.
